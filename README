This directory contains the source of the TOTP (RFC6238) algorithm
implemented in C.

TOTP stands for "Time-based One-Time Password" which is an algorithm
that extends the One-Time Password (OTP) algorithm, namely the HMAC-
based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm (RFC4226) to support the
time-based moving factor.

This source implements RFC6238 in C and can be compiled to .so shared
library for further uses.

This source is free software. See the file COPYING for further notices.
